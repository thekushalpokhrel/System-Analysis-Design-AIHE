# System Design: Architecting Solutions

This tutorial explores the process of designing system architectures and interfaces.

## 1. System Architecture

* **Identify architectural styles:**  (e.g., client-server, microservices, layered).
* **Consider scalability:**  How will the system handle increasing load?
* **Plan for security:**  Implement appropriate security measures.
* **Choose technologies:**  Select appropriate hardware and software.

## 2. Interface Design

* **User Interface (UI):** Focus on usability and user experience.
* **Application Programming Interface (API):** Define how different systems will interact.
* **Database Design:**  Create a data model that meets the system's needs.

## 3. Design Principles

* **Modularity:** Break down the system into smaller, manageable components.
* **Cohesion:** Keep related functionalities together.
* **Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between components.

## 4. Design Patterns

* **Understand common patterns:** (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).
* **Apply patterns appropriately:**  Use patterns to solve recurring design problems.

## Example: Layered Architecture
