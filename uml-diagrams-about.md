# UML Diagrams: Visualizing Systems

This tutorial introduces Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, powerful tools for visualizing system structure and behavior.

## 1. Use Case Diagrams

* **Actors:** Represent users or external systems interacting with the system.
* **Use Cases:** Describe specific actions or tasks users can perform.
* **Relationships:** Connect actors and use cases (e.g., include, extend, generalization).

## 2. Class Diagrams

* **Classes:** Represent objects or entities in the system.
* **Attributes:** Describe the characteristics of a class.
* **Methods:** Define the actions a class can perform.
* **Relationships:**  Illustrate how classes interact (e.g., association, aggregation, composition, inheritance).

## 3. Sequence Diagrams

* **Objects:** Represent instances of classes.
* **Messages:**  Show how objects interact over time.
* **Lifelines:** Represent the duration of an object's existence.

## 4. Activity Diagrams

* **Activities:** Represent actions or tasks.
* **Transitions:** Show the flow of control between activities.
* **Decision Points:** Represent conditional logic.

## 5. State Diagrams

* **States:** Represent the different conditions an object can be in.
* **Transitions:** Show how an object moves between states.
* **Events:** Trigger the transitions.
