# Requirements Elicitation: Uncovering User Needs

This tutorial covers the crucial first step in system development: understanding what users actually need.

## 1. Identifying Stakeholders

* **List all potential users:**  Think broadly â€“ direct users, indirect users, administrators, etc.
* **Prioritize stakeholders:** Focus on those with the most influence or who are most affected.
* **Schedule meetings:**  Arrange interviews, workshops, or focus groups.

## 2. Elicitation Techniques

* **Interviews:** Prepare open-ended questions.  Actively listen and take detailed notes.
* **Workshops:**  Bring stakeholders together for collaborative brainstorming and idea generation.
* **Use Cases:**  Describe how users will interact with the system.
* **Prototyping:** Create early mockups to get user feedback.
* **Surveys:** Gather data from a large number of users (useful for broader requirements).
* **Document Analysis:** Review existing documents (e.g., reports, manuals) for valuable insights.

## 3. Documenting Requirements

* **Use a consistent format:**  Create a template for your requirements documents.
* **Prioritize requirements:**  Use MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) or similar techniques.
* **Use clear and concise language:** Avoid jargon and ambiguity.
* **Traceability:** Link requirements to user needs and system features.

## 4. Validating Requirements

* **Review with stakeholders:** Ensure everyone agrees on the documented requirements.
* **Use prototypes:**  Demonstrate functionality and get user feedback.
* **Document changes:** Keep track of any modifications to the requirements.

## Example: Interview Questions

* "What are your current challenges with [existing system or process]?"
* "What would make your job easier?"
* "What are your must-have features for a new system?"

## Key Takeaways

* Requirements elicitation is an iterative process.
* Communication is key.
* Thorough documentation is essential.
