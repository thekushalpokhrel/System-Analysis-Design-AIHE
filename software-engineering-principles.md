# Software Engineering Principles: Building Quality Systems

This tutorial covers fundamental software engineering principles for building high-quality systems.

## 1. Modularity

* **Break down complex systems:** Divide the system into smaller, independent modules.
* **Benefits:** Easier to understand, develop, test, and maintain.

## 2. Cohesion

* **Keep related functionalities together:**  Modules should have high internal cohesion.
* **Benefits:**  Improved readability and maintainability.

## 3. Coupling

* **Minimize dependencies between modules:**  Modules should have low external coupling.
* **Benefits:**  Changes to one module are less likely to impact others.

## 4. Abstraction

* **Hide complex details:**  Provide a simplified view of the system.
* **Benefits:**  Makes the system easier to understand and use.

## 5. Encapsulation

* **Protect data:**  Restrict access to internal data and methods.
* **Benefits:**  Improved security and data integrity.

## 6. SOLID Principles

* **Single Responsibility Principle:** A class should have only one reason to change.
* **Open/Closed Principle:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle:** Objects of a derived class should be substitutable for objects of their base class.
* **Interface Segregation Principle:**  Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
