# Course System Analysis and Design (Masters of Business Information Systems)

This repository outlines the requirements, expectations, and assessment criteria for the System Analysis and Design course within the Masters of Business Information Systems program.  It serves as a central resource for students to access information and track their progress.

## Course Overview

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of system analysis and design. Students will learn how to elicit requirements, model systems, design solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness.  The course covers both traditional and agile methodologies, preparing students for real-world system development projects.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Understand the system development lifecycle.
* Elicit and document user requirements.
* Create various system models, including UML diagrams.
* Design system architectures and interfaces.
* Evaluate system feasibility and performance.
* Apply both traditional and agile development methodologies.
* Work effectively in teams on system development projects.

## Required Materials

* **Textbook:** TBA
* **Software:** TBA
* **Access:** Access to a computer with internet connectivity.

## Course Structure and Assessment

The course is structured around lectures, tutorials, and group projects.  Assessment will be based on the following components:

* **Individual Assignments (20%):**  These assignments will focus on specific concepts covered in the lectures, such as requirements elicitation, use case modeling, and system design.  They will be designed to build foundational knowledge.
* **Group Project (50%):**  Students will work in teams to develop a complete system analysis and design document for a real-world problem. This project is the core component of the course and will require students to apply all the concepts learned.  The project will be assessed based on the quality of the documentation, the feasibility of the proposed solution, and the team's presentation.
* **Midterm Exam (20%):**  This exam will cover the theoretical concepts and practical skills taught in the first half of the course.
* **Final Exam (10%):** This exam will cover the material from the entire course, with a focus on the second half and integration of concepts.

## Detailed Breakdown of Requirements and Expectations

### Beginner Level

* **Active Participation:** Attend all lectures and tutorials, actively participate in discussions, and ask questions when needed.
* **Basic Understanding:** Develop a foundational understanding of key concepts like the system development lifecycle, requirements elicitation, and basic UML diagrams (use cases, class diagrams).
* **Individual Assignments:** Complete all individual assignments on time and to the best of your ability.  Focus on understanding the core concepts and applying them correctly.
* **Group Project Contribution:**  Contribute actively to your group project.  Focus on understanding the assigned tasks and completing them effectively.  Effective communication within the group is crucial.

### Intermediate Level

* **Critical Thinking:** Begin to critically evaluate different system design approaches and understand their trade-offs.
* **Advanced Modeling:**  Develop proficiency in creating various UML diagrams, including sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams.
* **Requirements Analysis:**  Develop skills in analyzing and prioritizing user requirements, identifying potential conflicts, and proposing solutions.
* **Project Management:**  Understand basic project management principles and apply them to the group project, including task allocation, scheduling, and risk management.
* **Technical Writing:**  Develop skills in writing clear and concise technical documentation for the group project.

### Advanced Level

* **System Architecture:**  Understand different system architectures and be able to design appropriate architectures for complex systems.
* **Design Patterns:**  Learn and apply common design patterns to solve recurring design problems.
* **Agile Methodologies:**  Understand and apply agile development methodologies, such as Scrum or Kanban, to the group project.
* **Software Engineering Principles:**  Apply software engineering principles, such as modularity, cohesion, and coupling, to the design of the system.
* **Presentation Skills:**  Develop strong presentation skills to effectively communicate the group project's findings and design decisions.
* **Independent Learning:**  Demonstrate the ability to learn independently and research new technologies and techniques relevant to system analysis and design.

## Group Project Guidelines

* **Team Formation:**  Teams will consist of [Number] students.
* **Project Proposal:**  Each team will submit a project proposal outlining the problem they will address and their proposed solution.
* **Deliverables:**  The group project will require the submission of a comprehensive system analysis and design document, including requirements specifications, system models, design documents, and a prototype (if applicable).
* **Presentation:**  Each team will present their project to the class and instructors.
